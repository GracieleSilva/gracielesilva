Hello, my name is Graciele Selma da Silva, I am a person curious about new technologies and computer languages and you will find me occasionally learning a new language or risking something related lol. Here you will find some projects that are part of my continuous learning! ðŸ“˜ ðŸ“– ðŸ˜„

The languages that I have most knowledge at the moment are **Python** ðŸ’», But I also have knowledge in other languages, Java and Javascript

By the way I am open to new ideas, new projects, if you want to talk to me feel free. You can contact me at ðŸ“«:
